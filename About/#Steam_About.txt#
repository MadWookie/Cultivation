[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Mods which add soil for growing will not have tilled versions of that soil, and so it cannot be tilled. Other than that, there are no known compatibility issues.

[h1]Fertility Note[/h1]
If you don't like the increased difficulty from the soil changes, feel free to modify the Patches/Vanilla_Overwrites_AC.xml.
